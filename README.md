nvidia-opencl-examples
======================

Since nvidia currently does not provide any OpenCl examples, I'm hosting the 
latest OpenCl examples from Cuda version 4.2.9 here. 

And it just the files download from http://streamcomputing.eu/downloads/?Nvidia_OpenCL_SDK_4_2_Linux.zip

```
Copy the lib files to shared/lib and make
links files like 
ln -s /usr/lib64/libglut.so.3 /usr/lib64/libglut.so
```
